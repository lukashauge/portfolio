        <p style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>I'm a third year student at UCI. I speak English, Danish, and Japanese.
          I'm active in my university's video game development club as a UX/UI officer! I produce music, animate,
          and draw TONS of art! I combine my creativity with my affinity for programming to bring games to life. 
          Since developing Spigot plugins using Java in high school, I've known software/games engineering would be
          the perfect playground for me to express myself and sharpen my problem-solving brain.

              A narrative-driven cat detective game set some time during the 20th century in a city rattled by the resurgence of mysterious murders.
              As head detective of the Mew York Police Department, it is your duty to put a stop to these killings and exhume the secrets buried deep
              in the shadows of the cityâ€¦ 
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a project I wore many hats for! Originally pitched to VGDC @ UCI, this game is the product of 35 creative people working together for a year and a half.
              As the team lead, I handled department meetings and project management. If a team member got sick, I found ways to account for their deliverables.
              I created a large chunk of the artwork (including the Steam library capsule you see), composed music, animated characters, and designed & implemented the C# system architecture all while keeping the
              six departments motivated.
            </p>
            <p>
              After producing an animated trailer, The Brilliant Detective Milo is now available for wishlist on Steam! It will be ready to play once I draw
              the rest of the game's comic cutscenes and add some final polish. Get a feel for the game by clicking the button below!

              Vision Board is a concept for a technology that merges physical board games with the digital medium of video games.
              This team was small: only 4 people. Our tech is able to read game information off a board game and relay special effects
              onto a screen with nothing more than a phone/webcam and a laptop. No magnets, no sensors, just a camera! And it's all thanks
              to the power of our custom-trained AI model & piece classification algorithm. It's so efficient, it can run on practically any machine.

              I was the main gameplay programmer & systems developer for the Unity side of the project, in addition to working with UDP networking and protocol design.
              After presenting our project at the 2025 Beall-Butterworth competition, we won $3500 in funding to continue growing our concept into what could
              become a refreshing novelty in the board games industry.

              Wow, very meta... Talking about my portfolio site, on my portfolio site!
            </p>
            <p>
              This site was made as a definitive place to document all of my projects. It's made with React and TypeScript, featuring
              dynamic routing, interactive components, custom hooks, and a customized responsive layout. You may even find with the use of state management & event handling,
              there's a little game at the bottom you can play too! :)
            </p>
            <p>
              As I create more, this site will be updated with additional sections & features.
