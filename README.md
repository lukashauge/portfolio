## Welcome to my portfolio site!
This site is meant to show off some of the projects I've worked on so far. It includes fun, interactive elements like a custom-built Minesweeper game! This site will get updated as I create more cool things :)

## Here are some tools I used:
- **UI Design:** Figma, Clip Studio Paint
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- **Game Logic:** React reducer state logic, TypeScript
- **Deployment:** Vite, GitHub
